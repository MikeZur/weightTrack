Your New Year's resolution was to lose 20 lbs by February, but it's already April and you've only lost 5 lbs. Or maybe you aspire to have washboard abs, but your stomach still looks like a beer keg despite the 200 situps you've done. Achieving your health and nutrition goals is tough when you don't understand the balance between exercise and the food you put into your body.
